A Firefox addon distributed officially at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/faster-tab-browsing/

Use hotkeys and tab favorites to quickly jump between often used tabs or jump over several tabs.

- By default, pressing Shift + Page Up/Down advances over four tabs.

- Ctrl + Arrow Up (default) toggles the current active tab as a favorite, and you can jump between favorite tabs using Ctrl + Arrow Left/Right (default). All of these key combinations can be modified to some extent.

When you have a lot of tabs, works especially great when used with tree-style-tabs ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab ).

Known issues:

- Does not work correctly if working with more than one open windows of the same Firefox instance. This can be fixed if need be, but I am not sure if anybody actually uses more than one window. I guess I'll be waiting for feedback about this.
